 * many vitest processes in parallel (~11 concurrently):
 *   - threads pool: shares memory, much lighter than forks
 *   - maxThreads: 2: limits each vitest instance to 2 worker threads
 *   - fileParallelism: false: runs test files sequentially within each instance
 *
 * Net result: 11 instances × 2 threads = 22 threads (vs 154 forked processes).
